If the box in the middle of the window has something like "Problem loading" or "Error"
or if the game crashes for any reason, please contact me with the details displayed and 
a quick summary of what happened immediately before that.
Most of the game is oriented around missions or levels filled with enemies
To progress onto the next level you need to complete the current one.
At certain points in the game you will gain access to different levelsets
Each specialist (each member of your team) has certain stats.
These stats can be improved with training.
In order to train you need training tokens which are a common reward for completing levels.
The stats affect how effective the specialist is at different damage types with weapons 
as well as affecting their max health and aim. 
There are many different weapons in the game.
Each specialist can have up to 5 weapons in their weapon bag.
During a level a specialist can only access the weapons inside their weapon bag.
The specialist can change their equipped weapon for any weapon inside their weapon bag at any time.
Each weapon has an action cost which is how many stamina points are required to use the weapon
Each weapon also has up to 2 different damage types and amount of damage
More weapons can be bought in the weapon shop
