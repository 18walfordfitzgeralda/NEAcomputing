This the the readme for this github project. I have no idea what to put here.
I hope you find most of the stuff in the program is intuitive.
If you need help with this please contact me.
If you are unable to contact me in relation to this, then the odds are it is not worth the hassle anyway and you should probably give up.
This is line 5.
